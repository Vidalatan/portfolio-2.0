# Portfolio 2.0

## What is it?

This is an update to my previous portfolio. Since then I have learned a lot of new technologies and methods of implementing the things I wanted my portfolio to do. It is now entirely made with React.js, contains animations, nicer structure, and the ability to dynamically insert my repositories within the script file.


## Purpose 

Showcase my work (and progress) to employers and allow for a single point of refrence for my understanding of web-development
